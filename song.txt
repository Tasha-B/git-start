Bang, say da da da da
Tell me yes and let's feed the fire
Bang bang, say da da da
Nothin' less, I wanna hear a yes
Bang, say da da da da
Tell me yes and let's feed the fire
Bang bang, say da da da
Tell me yes

The word is out, got good news
We're gonna go for a midnight cruise
Steady weather, it's always cool
The street teaches
What you learn at school
Look out, the gang's all here
Gettin' tough in tender years

Come for a ride,
Straight up to heaven
Your rocket is ready
And it started counting down

Bang, say da da da da
Tell me yes and let's feed the fire
Bang bang, say da da da
Nothin' less, I wanna hear a yes
Bang, say da da da da
Tell me yes and let's feed the fire
Bang bang, say da da da
Tell me yes
